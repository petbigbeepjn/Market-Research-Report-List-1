<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Explosion-proof Fan Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Explosion-Proof Centrifugal Fan</li><li>Explosion-Proof Axial Flow Fan</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The explosion-proof fan market is primarily categorized into two types: explosion-proof centrifugal fans and explosion-proof axial flow fans. Centrifugal fans utilize a rotating impeller to generate high-pressure airflow, making them ideal for applications requiring significant air movement against resistance, such as in ventilation systems. In contrast, axial flow fans move air parallel to the fan axis, providing high flow rates at low pressure, suitable for cooling and ventilation in hazardous environments. Both types ensure safety in explosive atmospheres.</p></p>
