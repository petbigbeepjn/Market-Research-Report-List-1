<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Turbo Expander Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial-Axial Turbo Expander</li><li>Radial Turbo Expander</li><li>Axial Turbo Expander</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The turbo expander market encompasses three main types: radial, axial, and radial-axial turbo expanders. Radial turbo expanders utilize a radial flow design, ideal for moderate pressure drops and providing efficient energy recovery in smaller applications. Axial turbo expanders, on the other hand, feature an axial flow arrangement and are suited for high-capacity systems, offering superior efficiency in large-scale operations. Radial-axial turbo expanders combine elements of both designs, catering to applications that require versatile performance across varying pressure conditions.</p></p>
