<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Residential Dehumidifiers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical/ Refrigerative Dehumidifiers</li><li>Desiccant Dehumidifiers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The residential dehumidifier market is primarily categorized into two types: mechanical (refrigerative) dehumidifiers and desiccant dehumidifiers. Mechanical dehumidifiers use a refrigeration cycle to condense moisture from the air, making them effective in humid environments. They cool the air, causing water vapor to condense and collect. In contrast, desiccant dehumidifiers utilize hygroscopic materials to absorb moisture directly from the air, functioning well in lower temperatures and arid conditions. Each type serves distinct humidity control needs in households.</p></p>
