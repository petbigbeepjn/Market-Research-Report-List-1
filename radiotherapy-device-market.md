<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiotherapy Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Beam Radiotherapy Devices</li><li>Internal Beam Radiotherapy Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The radiotherapy device market is primarily divided into two main types: external beam radiotherapy devices and internal beam radiotherapy devices. External beam radiotherapy involves equipment that directs radiation from outside the body to target tumors, commonly using linear accelerators. In contrast, internal beam radiotherapy, also known as brachytherapy, involves placing a radioactive source directly within or adjacent to the tumor, allowing for targeted treatment with minimal damage to surrounding tissues. Both types are crucial in cancer treatment strategies.</p></p>
