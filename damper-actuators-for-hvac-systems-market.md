<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Damper Actuators for HVAC Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spring Return Damper Actuators</li><li>Non-Spring Return Damper Actuators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Damper actuators are essential components in HVAC systems, responsible for regulating airflow through ventilation ducts. There are two primary types: spring return and non-spring return damper actuators. Spring return actuators utilize a spring mechanism to return the damper to a pre-defined position when power is removed, ensuring safety and reliability. In contrast, non-spring return actuators maintain their position without a spring, relying on electrical signals, which allows for more precise control but may require additional safety measures during power outages.</p></p>
