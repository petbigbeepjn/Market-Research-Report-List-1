<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CMOS Sensors for Artificial Intelligence Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rolling Shutter</li><li>Global Shutter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CMOS sensors are vital in the artificial intelligence market, primarily characterized by two types: rolling shutter and global shutter. Rolling shutter captures images sequentially across the frame, which can lead to distortions in fast-moving scenes. This type is often used in smartphone cameras and low-cost systems. In contrast, global shutter captures the entire image simultaneously, preventing motion artifacts, making it ideal for applications in robotics and autonomous vehicles where precision is crucial. Both technologies cater to diverse AI-driven use cases.</p></p>
