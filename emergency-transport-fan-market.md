<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Emergency Transport Fan Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-invasive Ventilator</li><li>Invasive Ventilator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Emergency Transport Fan market includes two primary types of ventilators: non-invasive and invasive. Non-invasive ventilators facilitate breathing support without requiring intubation, utilizing masks or nasal interfaces, making them ideal for patients with respiratory distress who can still protect their airways. In contrast, invasive ventilators involve intubation and are used for patients with severe respiratory failure, requiring direct airway access for effective ventilation. Both types are critical in emergency settings for maintaining patient stability during transport.</p></p>
