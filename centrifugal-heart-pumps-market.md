<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Centrifugal Heart Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implantable Heart Pump Devices</li><li>Extracorporeal Heart Pump Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Centrifugal heart pumps are classified into two primary market types: implantable heart pump devices and extracorporeal heart pump devices. Implantable heart pumps are surgically placed within a patient's body to assist or replace heart function, often used in advanced heart failure cases. Extracorporeal heart pumps, on the other hand, are external devices that temporarily support circulation by diverting blood outside the body for various medical procedures, such as surgeries or critical care. Both types enhance cardiac output and improve patient outcomes.</p></p>
