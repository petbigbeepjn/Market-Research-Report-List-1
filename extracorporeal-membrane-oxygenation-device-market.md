<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Veno Artrial (VA)</li><li>Veno Venous (VV)</li><li>Artrio Venous</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) device market consists of three main types: Veno-Arterial (VA), Veno-Venous (VV), and Arterio-Venous (AV) ECMO. VA ECMO supports both cardiac and respiratory function by circulating blood from a vein to an artery, useful in severe cardiac failure. VV ECMO is primarily for respiratory support, facilitating oxygenation from veins without affecting the heart. AV ECMO is less common, used for renal support by providing oxygenated blood to the kidneys, ensuring efficient metabolic function.</p></p>
