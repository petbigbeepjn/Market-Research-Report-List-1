<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Passenger Car Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PHEV</li><li>BEV</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electric passenger car market comprises two main types: Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) and Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs). PHEVs combine a traditional internal combustion engine with an electric motor and rechargeable battery, allowing drivers to switch between electric and gasoline power. BEVs operate solely on electric power, relying on large battery packs and charging infrastructure. Both types contribute to reducing emissions, but BEVs typically offer greater environmental benefits due to their zero tailpipe emissions during operation.</p></p>
