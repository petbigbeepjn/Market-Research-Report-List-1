<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The AC Compressors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Displacement</li><li>Centrifugal Compressors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>AC compressors are essential components in cooling systems, classified mainly into two types: positive displacement and centrifugal compressors. Positive displacement compressors work by trapping a fixed volume of refrigerant and compressing it, providing consistent pressure and flow. They are commonly used in domestic and commercial air conditioning systems. In contrast, centrifugal compressors utilize high-speed rotating impellers to increase the refrigerant's velocity, converting it into pressure. They're typically found in larger installations due to their efficiency and capacity for high cooling loads.</p></p>
